					<h1>Money Guide</h1>
					<p>This document explains how to earn money in GTA Online with Stand.</p>
					<p>The most important thing to keep in mind regarding this is to not be greedy, because you won't need 500 million, but R* will be very glad you made it so obvious for them.</p>
					<h2>Rig Slot Machines</h2>
					<p>R* limits this to about GTA$ 50,000,000 per 24-hours, but due to the luck aspect, they can't properly patch it. However, they are quick to ban you for earning money via this method if your account has anti-cheat flags, which is why we advise against using this money method if you have used or are using other menus on your account. Furthermore, you should lose a few times after every win, to avoid temporarily losing access to the slot machines.</p>
					<h2>Sell Gifted Vehicles</h2>
					<p>You can use Stand's "Gift Spawned Vehicle" feature on yourself to get some nice vehicular assets, following <a href="/help/obtain-gift-any-vehicle-free">our guide here</a>. However, if you decide to go selling your garage's new fillings, keep within the safe limits:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Not more than 2 sales per 2 real-world hours.</li>
						<li>Not more than 7 sales per 30 real-world hours.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Cayo Perico Heist</h2>
					<p>Getting this heist set up is quite easy thanks to our "Quick Progress" options, and completing the heist itself will also be quite easy with the movement options or just good ol' teleporting.</p>
					<p>Note that R* has implemented a limit that prevents you from earning more than $2.550.000 per run or more than $4.100.000 per hour from this heist.</p>
					<!--<p>If you're gonna use this as a means to mod money, please don't do it more than once per real-world day and/or keep the time from when you paid for the heist to when you finished the finale within reasonable limits.</p>-->
					<h2>Lua Scripts</h2>
					<p>You may find Heist Control and MusinessBanager in Stand's Repository; these scripts allow you to use legit ways of earning money much more easily and have been extensively tested for safety.</p>
					<p><b>Do not</b> use random Lua scripts that aim to give you money. It is very, very likely that they use a detected money method, have not been properly tested, and will get you banned.</p>
